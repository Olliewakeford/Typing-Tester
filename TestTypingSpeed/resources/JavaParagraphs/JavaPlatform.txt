The Java platform, comprising Java Standard Edition (JSE), Java Enterprise Edition (JEE), and Java Micro Edition (JME), caters to various development needs from web applications to mobile devices. Since its initial release in 1996, Java has seen significant enhancements, notably Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which optimises execution by compiling code at runtime, aligning performance closer to that of native applications. Today, Java is maintained and distributed in two primary forms: Oracle's official version and the open-source OpenJDK, promoting widespread use and ongoing improvement.
