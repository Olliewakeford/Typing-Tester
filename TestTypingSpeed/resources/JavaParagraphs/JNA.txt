JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries without using JNI. It simplifies the process by automatically mapping Java method calls to native function calls, as defined in DLLs or shared libraries. JNA allows developers to write native-compatible code in Java, which is cleaner and easier to maintain compared to JNI, which requires manual specifications and is prone to errors if incorrectly handled​​.
