In Java, classes are dynamically loaded into the virtual machine (VM), meaning they are not read into memory until they are required, which enhances performance and flexibility. The ClassLoader is responsible for this, loading classes from specified paths and converting them into Class objects within the VM. Each class is identified uniquely within the VM by its full name and the ClassLoader instance that loaded it. A key feature of class loaders is their delegation model, where a class loader delegates the search for classes to its parent before attempting to find the class itself, preventing redundant definitions of the same class within the hierarchy.
