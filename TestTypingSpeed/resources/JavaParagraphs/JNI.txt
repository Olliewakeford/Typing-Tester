JNI is a framework that allows Java code running in the JVM to call and be called by native applications and libraries written in other languages like C or C++. This is useful for using platform-specific features or legacy libraries. JNI serves as a bridge by defining a set of standard interfaces which map Java types to native types, ensuring type safety and correctness in data transfer​​.
