The ServiceLoader provides a simple service-provider loading facility. It allows an application to pick up a service without having to know its actual implementation, which can be specified in configuration files under META-INF/services. This mechanism facilitates the modular addition of services, where the implementation provider can be swapped without changing the codebase. It decouples configuration and service provision from application logic, supporting greater modularity and flexibility.
