Bytecode is the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Each Java file is compiled into a class file containing Bytecode, which the JVM interprets. This Bytecode is not processor-specific and can be executed on any system that has a JVM, making Java applications portable across platforms. The class file structure includes metadata, the constant pool for storing literals and references, and the actual Bytecode instructions for the Java methods​​.
