Generics were introduced in Java 5.0 to enhance type safety and readability. They allow classes, interfaces, and methods to be parameterised, enforcing type correctness at compile time and reducing runtime errors. Features like bounded type parameters and wildcards (?) enhance flexibility by enabling code to restrict the types used as arguments and operate on collections of any object type more safely. Generics streamline Java development by enforcing stronger type checks and reducing casting overhead​​.
