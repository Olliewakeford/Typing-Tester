The Java Reflection API, part of java.lang.reflect, enables the inspection and modification of runtime properties of classes, interfaces, fields, and methods. Central to this API is the Class<T> class, which contains metadata about classes and can be accessed using methods like Object.getClass(), Class.forName(), and the .class syntax. This API allows for dynamic access to constructors , methods, and fields which facilitates writing generic code that can manipulate any object type. Reflection is essential for applications that need to instantiate objects at runtime or rely on runtime annotations for configuration. The API's flexibility supports dynamic class loading, greatly enhancing the adaptability and scalability of Java applications.
