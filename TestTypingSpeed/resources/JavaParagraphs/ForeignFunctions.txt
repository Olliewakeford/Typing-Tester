The Foreign Function and Memory API is a recent addition that provides structured access to non-JVM memory (off-heap) and facilitates calling foreign functions (e.g., those written in C). This is part of Project Panama and aims to replace JNI by providing a more performant and reliable interface for interoperation between Java and native code. It uses MemorySegment for safe memory operations outside of the standard JVM management, avoiding the overhead and complexity of JNI while maintaining safety and efficiency.
