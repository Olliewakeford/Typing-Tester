Annotations, introduced in Java 5, enrich code with metadata without affecting its run-time behaviour. Used extensively across classes, methods, and fields, annotations like @Deprecated, @Override, and @SuppressWarnings guide the compiler and tools for tasks like code inspection and configuration. Java 8 further expanded their use to type contexts and made annotations repeatable. Annotations underpin modern frameworks by enabling them to configure dynamically based on the code's descriptive metadata.
